<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Description :
BrainPulse is a cutting-edge mobile and web platform designed to transform mental health management in high-stress professional environments through personalized support, diagnostics, and therapeutic interventions. Utilizing AI and customized business portals, it enables organizations to enhance workforce well-being and productivity by providing employees with access to medically validated mental health strategies. This innovative solution addresses the urgent need for accessible, effective mental health care in sectors such as healthcare, military, sports, academia, and corporate workplaces.

## What is Our Problem? :
The modern workplace is facing a critical challenge related to mental health, with significant impacts on productivity and individual well-being. 
Annually, the United States experiences a loss of approximately 550 million days due to absences linked to stress, highlighting a pervasive issue within the professional environment. Stress-related conditions not only affect personal health but also result in considerable economic costs for employers and the broader society. Furthermore, studies, including those by The American Institute of Stress in 2022, reveal that 75% of individuals in high-stress fields suffer from mental health troubles, and 50% of all employees experience work-related stress. 
This data underscores the urgent need for effective solutions to manage and mitigate mental health issues in the workplace.
